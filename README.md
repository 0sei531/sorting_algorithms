Sorting algorithms are methods for arranging elements in a specific order. Examples include:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Radix Sort
Big O notation and evaluating time complexity:

Big O notation is a way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity in terms of the input size.
Common time complexities:
O(1): Constant time
O(log n): Logarithmic time
O(n): Linear time
O(n log n): Linearithmic time
O(n^2): Quadratic time
O(2^n): Exponential time
Selecting the best sorting algorithm for a given input:

The best sorting algorithm depends on factors such as the size of the data set, the nature of the data, and whether the data is partially ordered.
For small data sets or nearly sorted data, simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort may be efficient.
For large data sets, more advanced algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort are often preferred.
Stable sorting algorithm:

A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output as they appeared in the input.
Examples of stable sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and TimSort.
Understanding these concepts will help you analyze, compare, and choose the appropriate sorting algorithm based on the requirements and characteristics of the data you are working with.
